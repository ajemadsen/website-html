        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello! I am a Senior at BYU studying Computer Science, expecting to gradutate in 2024.
          I grew up in Alpine, UT (just 30 minutes north of Provo), and I have been living in Provo
          since 2018. I served an LDS mission in Wellington, New Zealand and Cincinnati, Ohio during
          the COVID pandemic. A little less than a year after returning home, I met my husband Carter!
          We were blessed to get married November of 2022, and now we live here in Provo with our 
          almost 4-month-old aussie-doodle puppy, Willow. 
        </p>
        <p>
          As far as my career goes, I am still trying to learn all I can to figure out for myself 
          what direction I want to go with my degree. I didn't have any background experience in
          the field, but I was able to catch on pretty naturally and I have been enjoying it. 
          I have the amazing opportunity right now to be a Web Developer on a rapid app development
          in the Center for Teaching and Learning here at BYU. I've been able to get real world 
          experience working with clients, implementing new features and processes and designing 
          web pages to create a seamless user experience. This has been an incredible opportunity 
          for me and I am excited to see what else is coming my way.
